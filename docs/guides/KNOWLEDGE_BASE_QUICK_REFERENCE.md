# Knowledge Base Quick Reference

This document is a fast map of the markdown files in `backend/knowledge_base/`.

It explains:

- the general format used across the knowledge base
- what kind of information each markdown contains
- which files are product definitions, workflow guidance, or scenario support

## Folder Purpose

The `backend/knowledge_base/` folder contains the grounded content used by the chatbot for insurance Q&A and quote-related explanations.

The files are short, practical markdown documents written for:

- RAG retrieval
- quote-flow explanation
- clarification of coverage, exclusions, limits, and examples
- assistant behavior guidance

## Common Markdown Format

Most files follow a simple pattern:

1. `# Title`
2. Short introductory paragraph explaining the topic
3. `##` sections for major knowledge blocks
4. Bullet lists for concrete facts, examples, or supported user questions

## Common Section Patterns

Several files reuse one of these formats.

## Overall Knowledge Design

The folder is organized in layers:

1. broad system and product grounding
2. quote input and pricing guidance
3. deeper coverage/exclusion explainers
4. claims and scenario examples
5. FAQ-style assistant behavior rules

This means the assistant can answer both:

- broad product questions
- workflow questions during quote collection
- scenario-based questions like `Would hail damage be collision or comprehensive?`

## Short Takeaway

If you want the fastest mental model:

- `01` = what the assistant is supposed to be
- `02-04` = the three main products
- `05` = quote tier meanings
- `06` = claims process
- `07` = FAQ behavior rules
- `08-10` = deeper product explainers
- `11` = discounts, eligibility, quote readiness
- `12` = example scenarios
